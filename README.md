# NewsApp

This app is using newsapi.org API to fetch tech related news from Tech Crunch.

## What i Learned:
1. Swift new concurrency with async/await and Task API.
2. Global actors(Main actor here).
3. MVVM pattern and how it works with SwiftUI.


## TODO
* Show alert instead of printing it when an error is thrown
* Make the API Client a protocol to make it easier to test
* Add the option to search for custom domains
* Improve the UI ðŸ˜¬
